* **Read these instructions repeatedly until you understand, then begin your project. If something is not clear, ask.**

## ❖・Before You Begin・❖

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/) on how to carry out this step and step `3`.
3. Clone your fork, using either the web site or the GitHub Desktop client.

## ❖・Introduction・❖

This assignment is designed to get you to _a_) practice advanced HTML, _b_) author more advanced CSS, and _c_) to start working with Sass. You’ll do so by implementing a web page — pixel-by-pixel — of the follow mockup, which you’ll find in `comps/focus.jpg`.

## ❖・Preflight・❖

1. Like assignment 2, ensure _editorconfig_, _Stylelint_, and _HTMLHint_ are installed as CLI tools via Node and as plugins in VS code.
2. You’ll also need to install `stylelint-config-sass-guidelines`. Do so via the following command:

```bash
npm i -D stylelint postcss stylelint-config-sass-guidelines
```

**Note**: Ignore any errors in VS Code akin to _“The value of the href attribute ... must be relative.”_

## ❖・Directions・❖

* You may **not** use any third-party HTML, CSS, or Sass libraries for this project. **All the code you include in this project _must_ be your own.**
* **Note** that the `style.css` file and the `css` folder you’ll need to create for this project will be ignored by default. This is fine, since I’ll build your CSS from the Sass code you submit.
* **No embedded or inline CSS is allowed.**
* Do **not** add any more files — of any type — to this project. Everything you need is included already.
* Your HTML must be valid.
* Your Sass must also be valid.
